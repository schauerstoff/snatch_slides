# snatch_slides

My image processing professor doesn't share his slides directly so i used image processing to snatch them from the uploaded video - top 10 anime comebacks.

Take a screenshot like every 5 seconds, crop it to the relevant data and paste it to the end of a word file. Export as pdf when done. Would still require the screencast to play, probably 2x or 5x speed.
